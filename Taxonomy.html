	  <p>Taxonomy of classification within the field of biology, particularly in the context of living organisms. In the field of biology, taxonomy is used to categorize and organize living organisms into different groups based on their shared characteristics. When it comes to animals, the taxonomy classifies them into various hierarchical levels, each representing a different form of classification. The standard hierarchy of animal taxonomy, from broadest to most specific, Domain includes all organisms with eukaryotic cells, Kingdom Animals are divided into smaller groups called phyla, Phylum includes animals that have fundamental similarities like for example animals with a notochord or backbone, such as mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, Class which is divided in groups such as Mammalia, which comprises of mammals, which are characterized by features such as having mammary glands, giving birth to live young, and possessing hair or fur, Order like for instance, the order Carnivora which includes animals like dogs, cats, and bears, which are carnivorous mammals, Family which are divided into groups like for instance, the family Felidae includes domestic cats, lions, tigers, and other felids, Genus, Families which are composed of different genera, representing groups of closely related species. For example, the genus Panthera includes lion (Panthera leo), tiger (Panthera tigris), and leopard (Panthera pardus). and finally species the most specific level of classification. It represents a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. It's important to note that taxonomy is a dynamic field, and as scientific understanding advances, changes and revisions may occur in the classification of organisms.<br></p></div>
